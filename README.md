![Software Developer Survey 2023 Salary Prediction](https://github.com/domywillygithub/DominicMahamba.github.io/blob/main/Salary%20prediction.jpg?raw=true)

## Overview
Welcome to the Predicting Software Developer Salaries project! This project aims to predict the salaries of software developers using machine learning techniques. By leveraging data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey for year 2023, the model is trained to estimate salaries based on factors such as country, education level, and years of professional coding experience. The model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input their information and receive a salary prediction.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
In this project, the Stack Overflow Developer Survey data was carefully cleaned and preprocessed to prepare it for modeling. This involved handling missing values, converting categorical variables, and performing feature engineering to extract relevant information.

## Model Training and Deployment
A machine learning model was trained to predict software developer salaries based on the preprocessed data. The model was evaluated using appropriate metrics and deployed using Streamlit, providing an intuitive user interface for salary predictions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain insights into software developer salaries. Visualizations were created to illustrate average salaries based on country and years of coding experience, helping to understand salary trends in the developer community.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) plays a crucial role in understanding the underlying patterns and trends in the data. In this project, an "Explore" page was created to interactively explore software developer salaries based on various factors such as country, education level, and years of professional coding experience.

Insights from the Explore page:
- **Number of Data from Different Countries:** Visualize the distribution of survey respondents across different countries, providing insights into geographical diversity in the dataset. This visual also plays an important part in salary predictions since its known that in machine learning predictions, the frequency of data points from each country directly influences the accuracy and reliability of salary forecasts. For instance:The United States of America, with 9430 data points, holds significant weight in shaping predictions due to its ample representation.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting software developer salaries. By analyzing data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023, valuable insights into factors influencing salaries were gained, and a predictive model was developed to estimate earnings. This project aims to inspire further exploration into salary trends and contribute to discussions on developer compensation.
